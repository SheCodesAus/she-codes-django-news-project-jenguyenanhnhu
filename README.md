TITLE: 
This blog started off as She Codes News and then it migrated and mutated into something different. Inspired by Lady Whistledown in Bridgerton, this website contains all the latest news, insider tea, and hot goss - told in 19th century proper English. The blog is designed to be enjoyed with a nice cup of tea and after promenading through the park with your chosen suitor.
